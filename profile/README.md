## 🎯 What is AdinCare?

AdinCare is a complete digital platform designed for comprehensive management of day centers and continuous follow-up of elderly patients and individuals. It was developed to address a real need: to simplify the work of care staff and guarantee more personalized, safe, and efficient care for each user.

Unlike traditional paper-based or spreadsheet systems, AdinCare centralizes all information in a single digital environment accessible from any device. This allows doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, and caregivers to work in a coordinated manner, sharing real-time updated data.

The platform is designed to improve both the quality of care services and the administrative management of the center, offering tools that range from patient initial registration to daily follow-up of their progress.


## 👥 Who is AdinCare for?

AdinCare has been developed specifically for day centers, such as Centro de Día Basurto, where continuous monitoring and observation of users' conditions are essential. However, its flexible design allows it to adapt to nursing homes, home care services, rehabilitation centers, and other healthcare environments that manage groups of patients or dependent individuals.

The system is designed for all profiles in the center:

- **Management and Administration**: Access comprehensive reports and monitor occupancy, resources, and staff.
- **Healthcare Staff**: Register measurements, treatments, incidents, and clinical progress.
- **Caregivers and Assistants**: Use a simplified dashboard to input observations and daily routines.
- **Authorized Family Members**: Consult users' general status and receive updates securely (optional by center configuration).
